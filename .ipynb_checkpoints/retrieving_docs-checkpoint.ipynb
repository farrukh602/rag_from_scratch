      "Document 64: The double standard of Political Correctness may have some validity insofar as it is a response to past injustices, mostly of the racial variety, but for Michael Moore to title his book \"Stupid White Men\" leaves him open, in my view, to as much criticism as I would rightly receive had I written a book called \"Dumbellionite Negroes\". The easy put-down of Moore is to say something like, \"It takes one to know one,\" but in all fairness, Moore is not stupid. Furthermore, conservatives such as myself love to tout the \"marketplace of ideas,\" because it is in this free discourse of Democracy where we succeed, whether it be talk radio, best selling books, Fox News, the rising tide of country music vs. Hollywood's recent failures, or the simple fact that Republicans now dominate the White House, the Congress, the Senate, governorships and state legislatures. We must begrudgingly accept the fact, however, that Moore is the exception to this rule. He succeeds. He is rich. He is popular. Therefore, to dispute him requires some intellectuial honesty.In the bad old days, the bigots might call Moore a \"traitor to his race.\" More appropriately, he might be considered a traitor to his class, because his arguments seem based on a refutation of the middle class system that many of us strongly believe makes America great, and we assume it is this \"class\" from which Moore emerges from. What  we think makes America great is something Moore thinks is lousy. Does this make him anti-American and unpatriotic? Again, to say so is the easy way out.The best way to dispute Moore is not to put him down, but to make an honest argument on behalf of America. To put things in sports terms, think of him as a guy who grows up in New York City and hates the Yankees. He has access to all the information about how the Yankees are the greatest dynasty in sports history, and is surrounded by admirers and fanatics of the team, yet he chooses to hate what represents him.Moore emerges from what I call the \"Emma Goldman school of anarchy.\" In the old days, guys like Moore would be dismissed as Communists and Socialists. Now that Communism has been defeated, most people do not even remember much about the ideology responsible for the murder of 100 million human beings in roughly 72 years. Calling somebody a Communist has little effect any more. So the Moore's of this world can no longer find comfort in Moscow. They no longer carry posters of Chairman Mao. What they are left with is a vague hatred for the winners, the powerful, the champions of history. In essence, the winners of history are America and Christianity. Anarchism, as espoused by Emma Goldman during World War I, is a mindset that never really goes away. In a free country it is free to be voiced, and Moore voices it.As for America's role in the world, we have little choice but to lead. America is the most powerful empire in the history of Mankind. What some call the \"shifting sands\" under our power is in fact our most legitimate strength, which is Democracy. The barbs, complaints and open criticisms of America are our greatest accompolishments, the most obvious examples of how we do it better and cleaner than any previous power. Imagine, for instance, a U.N. demanding an investigation into the Roman Empire's crucifixion of the Rabbi Christ; or demands on the floor of the U.N. for Britain to leave India circa 1890.Which brings us back to Michael Moore. Moore has access to all the information that tells anybody willing to accede to the slightest version of Truth that America is the greatest nation ever conceived by God, yet he chooses only to criticize it. In the end, his criticisms make the U.S. stronger, because the fact that he is wrong yet still free as a bird to publicly be wrong becomes known to all, thus giving America greater legitimacy through a constant \"trial by fire.\" Still, Moore deserves some judgment. What it comes down to is that he says things that are not true, while surely he possesses enough education and access to Truth to know they are not true. There is a word for this, and the fact that this word applies to Moore is knowledge we possess. \n",
